## My Projects

- 🎥 **Movie Review Sentiment Analysis System**
  - Developed a web application for analyzing user reviews about movies using a dataset of over 100,000 reviews (categorized as positive, negative, and neutral).
  - Used Random Forest and Logistic Regression to classify sentiments, splitting the data into a test set (20%) and a training set (80%).
  - Developed a web interface allowing users to input text and select the desired model. The system then predicts whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral and displays the results.
- 🌐 **SAW WiFi and Service** [Project](SAW-WIFI-AND-SERVICE.pdf)
   - Analyzed and designed an internet network system, developed from the AIS system, known as the SAW system. 
   - Created Use Case Diagram, Activity Diagram, Sequence Diagram, Class Diagram, State chart Diagram, and Data flow Diagram to illustrate system functionality.
   - Designed user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) prototypes using Figma.
  
- 📈 **Dashboard & Story Marvel Movie Project** [Marvel Movie](Business-data.md)
  - Developed data-driven storytelling and interactive dashboards to analyze and compare global box office revenues of films across different studios.
  - Evaluated revenue versus production budgets to calculate profit or loss, providing insights into the financial performance of each film by studio
